# To-Do-List-Creator
A To-Do list generator Project ( part of my JavaScript project coding practice from YouTube) 

What did I learn? Even though I was follwoing the youtube tutorial to make the project, at the end , it did not work. The reason was even though I copied all the codes, there were some mistakes I made that I had to find myself as they are not in the tutorial. I found them and solved them one by one. Now I understand which part of the code is responsible for which part of the project. 
This is how the learning process improves.
